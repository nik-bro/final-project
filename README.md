## Project Proposal

Name(s) of the folks involved in this project:

Nik

Working title:

"Maybe it just happened that way: Testing stochasticity as the primary determinant of intercontinental megafaunal exchange across the Bering Land Bridge"

Project summary (1-2 sentences):

Why some megafauna (e.g. woolly mammoths) crossed the Bering land bridge and established populations on both North America and Eurasia while others (e.g. woolly rhinoceros) did not is still poorly understood, with most hypotheses relying on some gating factor on the bridge itself, such as moisture. I will attempt to assess whether models of dispersion such as equilibrium theory of biogeography or the UNTB which do not rely on traits can accurately characterize the amount of megafaunal migration between continents.


What is especially interesting (to you!) about this project?:

I think that this is a really interesting system with which to think about these models, as NA and Eurasia are sort of mutual islands for species exchange. Why some species crossed has always interested me, and I'm curious as to whether there was actually a 'gate' on the bridge - and if so, how much migration it would actually have to account for stopping.

How do you plan to tackle this project?:

Review the literature to characterize the number of species evolving on each continent, figure out times when bridge was exposed. Attempt to tune a stochastic migration model to match the # and rate of species exchange between continents. Possibly use aDNA based population genetics literature to infer actual rate of migration in bicontinental species.

What concepts or tools from class relate to this project?:

UNTB, Equilibrium theory of biogeography.

What additional resources (code, data, literature) would support this project?:

Not sure yet.

How can Andy or Renata help?:

Just sitting down and talking through a sensible way to go about this project would be super helpful.
